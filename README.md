## Code Explanation
The core functionality of the application is implemented in JavaScript, which interacts with the GitHub API. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the main components:

- **HTML Structure**: The form is defined with an `id` of `github-user-test`, which captures the username input.
  
- **JavaScript Fetch API**: 
   - The application uses the `fetch` function to make a GET request to the GitHub API endpoint for user data.
   - Upon receiving a response, it extracts the `created_at` field from the JSON response, which contains the account creation date.
   - The date is then formatted to YYYY-MM-DD UTC and displayed in the designated output section.

- **Error Handling**: The application includes basic error handling to manage cases where the username does not exist or if there are issues with the API request.
